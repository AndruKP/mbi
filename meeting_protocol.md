# First meeting protocol 

Attended: Andrukhovskyi, Chutňáková, Kabátová, Kamas (leaved before ending of the meeting, apologized), M.Lukáč, Pitoňák, Tatarevska.

Discusion:
- Biology underneath TFBSs and transcription --- we've discussed what is TF, TFBS, and why it is important to analyze TFBSs
- Computational approach --- we've discussed what computational methods were used in the paper --- in the end we've decided that we need to read paper about MATCH
- We did try to run a Ciiider program on test data --- it worked pretty well.

Also we've came up with a plan. 
## Report structure and responsibiliteas
1. Introduction - TBA
2. Computational methods (Terezia, David)
    1. MATCH 
    2. Statistics behind enrichment analysis
3. Biological results - Hanna and Denys
4. "an explanation how the paper relates to the course material" will be discussed after Nov 13, when lecture on TFs will be.
5. Papers (Gabriela, we will discuss later results, Denys can help)

Review: (should be everyone) and Denys is responsible.

We'll use google docs for writing (to colaborate in real time), maybe importing result to nicer format (latex/typst/md -> pdf) before submitting

We will most probably meet again; we will vote for exact date, but it will not be sooner as 21 November.
